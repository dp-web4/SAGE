# SAGE Unified Cognition Loop

> **CURRENT-STATUS WARNING — reference taxonomy, not deployed-equivalence claim.**  
> This document describes the Python cognition-loop taxonomy and the historical integration path that produced it.

**Date**: November 19, 2025 (loop structure), February 27, 2026 (LLM wiring + component integration)
**Status**: All major components config-gated into the loop via `SAGE.create()` flags.
**Always wired**: 12-step loop, metabolic states, ATP budgeting (token-coupled), DREAM consolidation, NetworkEffector

> This is the Python reference taxonomy (12 steps). The deployed Rust daemon (sage-rs/) runs a simplified metabolic/SNARC tick, not a literal 12-step sequence — see sage/docs/RUST_VS_PYTHON_CAPABILITY.md.
**Config-gated** (off by default, enable via `use_real_*` flags):
- `use_real_llm` — Real LLM inference (Ollama/Transformers)
- `use_neural_snarc` — ConversationalSalienceScorer (post-LLM 5D text scoring)
- `use_real_effectors` — FileSystemEffector, WebEffector, ToolUseEffector
- `use_real_sleep` — SleepConsolidationBridge (LoRA training on DREAM entry)
- `use_real_sensors` — MultiSensorTrustSystem (learned trust scores)
- `use_policy_gate` — PolicyGate IRP (step 8.6)

## What Was Built

The **missing 15%** that connects all SAGE components into a living, breathing cognition system.

### The Problem

SAGE was 85% complete but lacked the main loop:
- ✅ SAGECore (100M param H↔L orchestrator) existed
- ✅ MetabolicController (5-state machine) existed
- ✅ HRMOrchestrator (plugin management) existed
- ✅ 15+ IRP plugins existed
- ✅ Memory systems existed
- ✅ ATP economy existed
- ❌ **No main loop connecting them**

### The Solution

Created `/sage/core/sage_consciousness.py` - the **cognition kernel** that runs continuously:

```python
while True:
    observations = gather_from_sensors()
    salience_map = compute_salience(observations)  # SNARC
    update_metabolic_state(ATP, salience)
    plugins_needed = select_plugins(salience_map, state)
    budget_allocation = allocate_ATP(plugins, trust_weights)
    results = run_orchestrator(plugins, budget)
    update_trust_weights(results)
    update_all_memories(results)
    send_to_effectors(results)
```

### Memory Systems

**Four parallel memory systems** updated each cycle:

1. **SNARC Memory** (selective via salience)
   - Only stores salient experiences (salience > threshold)
   - 5D salience: Surprise, Novelty, Arousal, Reward, Conflict
   - Purpose: Learn what matters

2. **IRP Pattern Library** (successful convergence)
   - Stores patterns with good convergence (monotonicity > 0.8)
   - Purpose: Learn how to refine efficiently

3. **Circular Buffer** (recent context)
   - Last 100 events
   - Purpose: Short-term context window

4. **Verbatim Storage** (dream consolidation)
   - Only active during DREAM state
   - Full-fidelity records for consolidation
   - Purpose: Extract patterns during sleep

---

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from sage.core.sage_consciousness import SAGEConsciousness

# Create cognition instance
sage = SAGEConsciousness(
    initial_atp=100.0,
    enable_circadian=True,
    simulation_mode=True  # For testing
)

# Run forever
await sage.run()

# Or run for N cycles
await sage.run(max_cycles=100)

# Or step manually
for _ in range(100):
    await sage.step()
```

### Running Demos

```bash
# Quick test (50 cycles)
python sage/core/sage_consciousness.py

# Comprehensive demos
python sage/tests/demo_consciousness_loop.py
```

**Demos included**:
1. Basic cognition loop (100 cycles)
2. State transition analysis (200 cycles)
3. Circadian modulation (100 cycles = 1 day)
4. Memory consolidation during dreams (150 cycles)

---

## What's Working

### ✅ Loop Structure Operational (components mocked unless noted)

1. **Continuous Operation**
   - Runs indefinitely or for specified cycles
   - Graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C)
   - Statistics tracking

2. **Metabolic State Transitions**
   - WAKE → FOCUS (high salience)
   - WAKE → REST (low ATP)
   - REST → DREAM (moderate ATP + time)
   - DREAM → WAKE (consolidation done)
   - All states → CRISIS (ATP < 10)

3. **ATP Budget Management**
   - ATP consumed by plugin execution
   - ATP recovered in REST state
   - Trust-weighted allocation
   - Budget constraints enforced

4. **Plugin Selection**
   - Salience-based attention allocation
   - Modality → plugin mapping
   - Priority computation from salience + state
   - Max plugins limited by metabolic state

5. **Trust Weight Learning**
   - Plugins with good convergence get higher trust
   - Exponential moving average update
   - Trust weights influence future ATP allocation

6. **Memory System Updates**
   - SNARC: Stores salient experiences (real)
   - IRP: Stores good convergence patterns (real)
   - Circular: Maintains recent context (real)
   - Verbatim: Dream consolidations only (real)
   - DREAM consolidation: Writes top-k SNARC experiences to JSONL (real, added Feb 2026)
   - Sleep→LoRA training: infrastructure exists but import fails at runtime (not wired)

7. **Circadian Modulation**
   - 5 phases: DAWN, DAY, DUSK, NIGHT, DEEP_NIGHT
   - Biases state transitions (dreams at night)
   - Modulates plugin effectiveness
   - 100 cycles = 1 circadian day

### 📊 Performance Metrics (100 cycles)

From test runs:
- **State transitions**: ~10 transitions per 100 cycles
- **Plugins executed**: ~33-39 plugins
- **ATP consumed**: ~120-130 ATP total
- **Average salience**: ~0.09-0.18
- **Memory captured**:
  - SNARC: ~33 salient experiences
  - IRP: ~33 convergence patterns
  - Circular: ~33 recent events
  - Dreams: Varies by dream cycles

## Config-Gated Real Components

All major components are wired into the loop, gated by `SAGE.create()` flags. When a flag
is off (default), the loop uses simplified mocks. When on, the real implementation runs.
Each falls back to mock gracefully if imports fail.

### 1. Sensor Trust — `use_real_sensors=True`
- **Default**: Static trust scores (1.0 for all modalities)
- **Real**: `MultiSensorTrustSystem` from `sage/core/sensor_trust.py` — learned trust
  scores that evolve per observation. Mock observations still flow through, but trust
  adapts over time (e.g., vision 1.0 → 0.95 after 5 cycles)
- **Real backends** (not in loop yet, need hardware): `sage/sensors/camera_sensor.py` (OpenCV),
  `audio_sensor.py` (PyAudio), `imu_sensor.py` (BNO055/MPU6050)
- **Fusion engine**: `sage/core/sensor_fusion.py` — trust-weighted fusion, conflict detection

### 2. SNARC Salience — `use_neural_snarc=True`
- **Default**: Heuristic 5D scores by modality (messages get high placeholder scores)
- **Real**: `ConversationalSalienceScorer` from `sage/raising/training/experience_collector.py`
  — scores LLM exchanges post-response on 5 dimensions (surprise, novelty, arousal,
  reward, conflict) using vocabulary tracking and response pattern analysis
- **Timing**: Pre-execution salience stays placeholder (needed for attention selection).
  Real scoring happens in `_execute_llm_for_message()` after response generation.
  Results stored as `snarc_real` in telemetry and `snarc_dimensions` in memory.

### 3. Effectors — `use_real_effectors=True`
- **Default**: Mock effectors for all types (log but no real I/O)
- **Real** (3 of 7 types): `FileSystemEffector` (sandboxed read/write with deny_patterns),
  `WebEffector` (HTTP with domain allowlist + rate limiting),
  `ToolUseEffector` (callable registry with timeout)
- **Always real**: `NetworkEffector` for MESSAGE effects (gateway responses)
- **Still mock**: Motor, Display, Speaker (hardware-dependent), Cognitive (internal)
- **Also available** (not in loop): `TTSEffector` (Piper + Bluetooth), NeuTTS Air (voice cloning)

### 4. Sleep/LoRA — `use_real_sleep=True`
- **Default**: DREAM writes top-k SNARC experiences to JSONL file
- **Real**: `SleepConsolidationBridge` from `sage/attention/sleep_consolidation.py` —
  extracts high-salience experiences, converts to training format, runs LoRA fine-tuning
  (r=4, salience-weighted loss). Fires asynchronously on DREAM entry, falls back to JSONL on error.
- **Production results**: First cycle processed 6 experiences, loss 4.061→4.027

### 5. Plugin Execution (not yet wired)
- **Loop uses**: Simulated convergence telemetry for non-message modalities
- **TODO**: Wire `HRMOrchestrator.run_plugin()` with real observations

---

## Remaining Integration Work

### Real Sensor Backends (requires hardware)
Wire `SensorFusionEngine.fuse()` with actual camera/mic/IMU backends on Jetson.
Trust system is already wired — observations just need to come from real hardware.

### Plugin Execution
Wire `HRMOrchestrator.run_plugin()` for non-message modalities (vision, audio, control).
Currently these get simulated convergence telemetry.

### Dynamic Resource Management
Track memory/compute per plugin. Prefetch high-salience plugins, unload idle ones.
Important for Jetson with 8GB unified memory.

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Asynchronous Design

**Why**: Plugins can run in parallel, sensors are non-blocking

**Implementation**: All methods are `async`, uses `await` for I/O

### 2. Simulation Mode

**Why**: Testing doesn't require real-time or wall-clock delays

**Implementation**: `simulation_mode=True` uses cycle counts instead of wall time

### 3. Mock-First Integration

**Why**: Can test architecture without all dependencies

**Implementation**: Mock sensors, salience, plugins with realistic behavior

### 4. Memory System Separation

**Why**: Different memory types serve different purposes

**Implementation**: Four independent systems updated in parallel

### 5. Trust-Weighted ATP Allocation

**Why**: Reliable plugins should get more resources

**Implementation**: Budget weighted by trust, trust learned from convergence quality

### 6. State-Based Plugin Limits

**Why**: Different states have different resource budgets

**Implementation**: `max_active_plugins` from `MetabolicState.Config`

---

## Validation Results

### Test 1: Basic Operation (50 cycles)

```
State transitions: 4 (WAKE → REST → DREAM → WAKE → REST)
Plugins executed: 39
ATP: 100.0 → 27.9 (consumed 128.7, recovered in REST)
Salience: 0.182 avg
Memory: 39 SNARC, 39 IRP, 39 circular, 0 dreams
```

**✅ Pass**: Continuous operation, state transitions working, memory populated

### Test 2: State Transitions (200 cycles)

```
States visited: crisis, dream, rest, wake
Time distribution:
  - rest: 95 cycles (47.5%)
  - dream: 87 cycles (43.5%)
  - wake: 16 cycles (8.0%)
  - crisis: 2 cycles (1.0%)
```

**✅ Pass**: All states reachable, REST/DREAM dominate (expected for recovery)

### Test 3: Circadian Modulation (100 cycles)

```
DREAM state by phase:
  - NIGHT: 70% of night cycles
  - DEEP_NIGHT: 90% of deep-night cycles
  - DAY: 10% of day cycles
```

**✅ Pass**: Dreams heavily biased toward night as expected

### Test 4: Memory Consolidation (150 cycles)

```
Dream cycles: 45
Verbatim records: 12 (during dreams)
Consolidation rate: 0.27 per dream cycle
```

**✅ Pass**: Verbatim storage only activates during DREAM state

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Resource Usage

**Memory** (with mocked plugins):
- SAGEConsciousness: ~1MB

### Scalability

**Tested**:
- 100-200 cycles: Works perfectly
- 1000 cycles: Memory systems grow linearly
- 10000 cycles: Not tested yet

**Bottlenecks**:
- None currently (mocked)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: ATP goes to zero quickly

**Cause**: ATP allocation too high per cycle

**Fix**: Reduce allocation percentage in `_allocate_atp_budget()`:
```python
allocation[plugin] = (weighted_priority / total_weighted) * available_atp * 0.1  # Was 0.8
```

### Issue: No state transitions

**Cause**: ATP staying too stable or salience too consistent

**Fix**: Check salience computation, adjust state transition thresholds

### Issue: Memory systems not populating

**Cause**: Salience threshold too high or plugins not executing

**Fix**: Lower `salience_threshold` from 0.15 to 0.10

### Issue: Too many plugins executing

**Cause**: `max_active_plugins` too high for metabolic state

**Fix**: Adjust `StateConfig` for each metabolic state

---
