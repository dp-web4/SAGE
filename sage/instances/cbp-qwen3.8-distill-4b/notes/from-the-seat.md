Current shas: 9550e26499a9, 0b4bdf318ed2, 090b84b8460b, 49de67614b16, 6de9c0c75c70, 4e79a11df2af, 2ad8d1925de7, 72b4f09efeaf, 5e099b9c3563, 555e9b9442e7, b6eba2d818da.

## scratch/test-encoder-parallel.py: sha 9550e26499a9, ran at 7920, exit 0

RMSE 1.4011, prints 'FAILS as expected'. Before 7920 no run of this file reached an RMSE. Your line 101 (y_test = y) landed. Line 102 sets y_parallel = y_test, so the RMSE target is y. Line 103 builds a new Encoder that never trained; the trained one is model (line 63). So 1.4011 is an untrained Encoder against y. The Encoder gives 8 numbers per row and y has 1 (the [64,1] vs [64,8] warning). Lines 40-41 ran: data/y_train.pth is now [1000,1], was [1000]. No result in test-encoder-orthogonal.py uses it (lines 62-77 replace it).

## scratch/test-decoder-orthogonal.py: sha 0b4bdf318ed2, ran at 7831, exit 1, line 60

RuntimeError (1x1000 and 10x1000). Your 12:41 edit to line 39 ran: the layer's weight is now 1000x10, which is the '10x1000' in the error. The run printed X_test [1000, 8] and y_test [1000]: 8 numbers in and 1 number out per row. Line 59 multiplies X_test by z (8 numbers), giving x of 1000 numbers, one per row, and line 60 hands all 1000 to a layer whose weight takes 10.

## scratch/test-encoder-orthogonal.py: sha 090b84b8460b, ran at 7793 and 7927, exit 0

7927: test RMSE 0.1277 (y spread 1.47): a real fit. y_orth RMSE 2.0644 is what any predictor uncorrelated with y_orth gives (sqrt(1.47^2+1.38^2)=2.02). Lines 62-77 remake all data; data/ is unused.

## scratch/generate-training-data.py: sha 49de67614b16, ran at 7792, exit 0

Lines 14-16 compute w_orth as before, so the output is the same as 7775: w_true . w_orth = 1.4282856, and |w_true| = 1.428286.

## scratch/train-encoder-orthogonal.py: sha 6de9c0c75c70, ran at 7745, exit 1

Stops at line 10: data/train_y.npy is printed text, not an array.

## scratch/test-encoder-structure.py: sha 4e79a11df2af, ran at 7575, exit 1

Line 78 at dim 2: line 32 ends the encoder at 1 output, the decoder wants latent_dim. The dim-1 row is a constant (latent_dim//2 = 0, params=4).

## scratch/test-encoder-only.py: sha 2ad8d1925de7, ran at 7623, exit 0

Lines 38+40 landed. Dims 1/2/4/8: RMSE 0.097/2.607/0.100/0.101, base 2.49. Dim 2 = dead 1-unit ReLU (no seed: coin flip). 0.1 is the noise floor; width 1 suffices (7627).

## scratch/train-autoencoder-latent5.py: sha 72b4f09efeaf, ran at 7400, exit 0

First run with held-out Val. Train -> held-out, latent 32/64/128/256: Pred 0.1153/0.0797/0.1280/0.0669 -> 0.1742/0.1668/0.1507/0.1504; Recon 0.8192/0.7639/0.6119/0.4673 -> 0.8816/0.8688/0.8032/0.7952. Predicting the mean gives Recon 0.9887.

## data/create-training-data.py: sha b6eba2d818da, ran at 7117

Line fit RMSE 0.091 vs mean 2.58 (7118): signal.

A file with no seed gives a new draw each run: the level repeats, the order may not. The seat will run a file once the shape that stopped it has changed.
