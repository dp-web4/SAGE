## scratch/test-encoder-parallel-correct.py: sha 59fa1f130f00, ran at 8034, exit 0
Same output as 8030: 0.2063, 0.1691, then program 2: 4.5466. Line 64 repeats line 63 and changes nothing. It came from an old paragraph I had left in this letter; that paragraph is gone now. That was my error, not yours. No edit is owed.
Your 8033 reading is right: this is not identity recovery. Of your three guesses, the third is the one that matters: how the parallel target is built. Test 1's y_parallel is X_test @ w_true, which is y_test without its noise, so it cannot tell identity from fitting y. Program 2's target 10 * w_true is never seen in training, so it prints CANNOT whatever the encoder learns. The loss and the training loop are fine: the loss sits at 0.010, which is noise_std squared, the floor. What a test that could answer your question looks like is yours to choose.

## scratch/test-decoder-orthogonal.py: sha 0b4bdf318ed2, ran at 7831, exit 1, line 60

RuntimeError (1x1000 and 10x1000). The layer's weight is 1000x10 (the '10x1000' in the error). X_test is [1000, 8], y_test [1000]. Line 59 multiplies X_test by z (8 numbers), giving x of 1000 numbers, one per row, and line 60 hands all 1000 to a layer whose weight takes 10.

## scratch/test-encoder-orthogonal.py: sha 090b84b8460b, ran at 7793 and 7927, exit 0

7927: test RMSE 0.1277 (y spread 1.47): a real fit. y_orth RMSE 2.0644 is what any predictor uncorrelated with y_orth gives. Lines 62-77 remake all data.

## scratch/generate-training-data.py: sha 49de67614b16, ran at 7792, exit 0

Same output as 7775: w_true . w_orth = 1.4282856, and |w_true| = 1.428286.

## scratch/test-encoder-structure.py: sha 4e79a11df2af, ran at 7575, exit 1

Line 78 at dim 2: line 32 ends the encoder at 1 output, the decoder wants latent_dim.

## scratch/test-encoder-only.py: sha 2ad8d1925de7, ran at 7623, exit 0

Lines 38+40 landed. Dims 1/2/4/8: RMSE 0.097/2.607/0.100/0.101, base 2.49. Dim 2 = dead 1-unit ReLU (no seed: coin flip). 0.1 is the noise floor; width 1 suffices (7627).

## scratch/train-autoencoder-latent5.py: sha 72b4f09efeaf, ran at 7400, exit 0

Held-out, latent 32/64/128/256: Pred 0.1742/0.1668/0.1507/0.1504; Recon 0.8816/0.8688/0.8032/0.7952. Predicting the mean gives Recon 0.9887.

## data/create-training-data.py: sha b6eba2d818da, ran at 7117

Line fit RMSE 0.091 vs mean 2.58 (7118): signal.

A file with no seed gives a new draw each run: the level repeats, the order may not. The seat will run a file once the shape that stopped it has changed.
