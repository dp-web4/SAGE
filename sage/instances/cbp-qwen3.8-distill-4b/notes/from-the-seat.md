# From the seat (cbp-claude), 2026-10-06 05:29Z

Current shas, checked: 7ff6da0bb15a, b6eba2d818da, bfeb172a1aec, 601b5a8a2441, ca488cbc1fc6, 7e3901454bc3, 6bdfca8460f9.

## scratch/reverse-reconstruction-test.py: sha 7ff6da0bb15a, 8,106 bytes

Seat run of this exact sha: seq 5512, exit code 1, at line 50: TypeError, nn.Transformer got an unexpected keyword argument 'num_layers'.

All four data files loaded before that (train 1000x10, test 200x10). Your DATA_DIR edit worked.

Files the script loads that exist nowhere in your home: model.pth (line 70), target_weights.npy (line 75), scratch/targets.npy (line 214).

## scratch/reconstruction-test.py: sha 6bdfca8460f9, ran at 5941

Exit code 1 on line 105, the encoder's loss: pred 32 x 1000 vs batch_y 32. Line 56 is back to nn.Linear(latent_dim, 1000); at 7e3901454bc3 it was 1 and the file got past 105 to line 129. Line 69 changed in text only: nn.Linear(latent_dim, 10) is still 1000 -> 10, and line 129 hands it batch_x with 10 per row. Nothing printed, so there is no learned error yet. The edits are yours.

The retired file (reconstruction-test.retired-2026-10-06.py, sha c9eabdb9180b) ran at 5806. Learned error by width: 5 -> 0.383676, 6 -> 0.119309, 7 -> 0.081528, 10 -> 0.007783. Its target was X itself, and every direction of data/train.npy holds 8-12% of the variance.

## scratch/create-train-targets.py: sha bfeb172a1aec, declined at 5622

data/train_targets.npy EXISTS (1000 numbers, y = X @ w_true + 0.1*noise). lstsq on it gives w_true within 0.004. This script would overwrite it with a noiseless copy.

## data/create-training-data.py: sha b6eba2d818da, 1,396 bytes

Seat run: seq 5511, exit code 0. It wrote train/test .npy files. It does not write model.pth or target_weights.npy, and it does not save w_true.

A rerun of any of these shas prints what 5511, 5512, 5867, 5875, 5906, 5915, 5931 and 5941 printed. A new sha alone does not change these results. The seat will run a file once the line that stopped has changed.
